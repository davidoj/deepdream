    "This is the sort of software Facebook uses to guess which of your friends are in a photo. In particular, we are investigating a kind of image recognition software called a *neural network*.\n",

    "A neural network is arranged in a series of layers. The image passes through each layer starting with *c1*, and each layer performing a particular kind of processing to the image. At the end, the network outputs the objects it has identified:\n",

    "  \n",
    "We can think of each layer having the job of looking for some particular features in the image. Early layers look for simple things like edges or curves, layers in the middle look for different kinds of shapes and layers at the end might look for eyes, animals or buildings.\n",

    "Human and animal brains also process the images from their eyes in layers. Early layers look for simpler features, and later layers look for more complex ones.\n",

    "If you click on a cell with code in it and press **shift-enter** it will run what is in the cell. Make sure you start at the top. If you run a cell at the bottom and it doesn't work, it might be because you haven't run the cells at the top yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to change anything to use this notebook - run everything first to see what it does! When you do want to try changing things, remember that pressing **ctrl-z** will undo whatever you've done in the cell you currently have selected. If you make a change and things stop working, try pressing **ctrl-z** a few times until it starts working, then try again!"
